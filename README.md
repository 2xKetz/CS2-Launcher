## 📜 Overview
The **CS2 Launcher** is a **lightweight, high-performance tool** built for **Counter-Strike 2** players who want speed, customization, and control.  
With **one click**, you can launch CS2 in your **preferred resolution**, switch between **competitive & normal desktop settings**, and get back to fragging without wasting time.

---

## ✨ Features
- 🎯 **Auto Resolution Switching** – Switch to a target resolution when CS2 starts, restore when closed.
- ⚡ **Instant Launch** – Start CS2 directly via Steam App ID or custom path.
- 🖼 **Custom Launcher Wallpaper** – Personalize your launcher UI.
- 🔍 **Real-time Game Detection** – Automatically applies resolution changes when CS2 is in focus.
- 💻 **Clean & Modern UI** – Built with PySide6 for a pro feel.
- 🚫 **VAC Safe** – No game file modifications, works only with Windows display settings.
